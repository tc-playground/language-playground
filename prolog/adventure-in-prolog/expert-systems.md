# Expert Systems

## Introduction

* `Expert systems` are often called `rule-based systems`. 

* The rules are "rules of thumb" used by experts to solve certain problems. 

* The expert system includes an `inference engine`, which knows how to use the rules.

* There are many kinds of `inference engines` and `knowledge representation` techniques that are used in expert systems. 

* Prolog is an excellent language for building any kind of expert system. 

 * Certain types of expert systems can be built directly using Prolog's native rules. These systems are called `structured selection` systems.
